* Question
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

* Solution
Iterate through the island co-ordinates

- If we hit land, increment the seen island counter, and clear the island
- Continue checking the map co-ordinates

*** Result
  Runtime: 296 ms, faster than 5.02% of Python online submissions for Number of Islands.
  Memory Usage: 21.1 MB, less than 86.01% of Python online submissions for Number of Islands.

* Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

* Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

* Constraints:

    m == grid.length
    n == grid[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 300
    grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
